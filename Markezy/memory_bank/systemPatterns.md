# System Patterns - Markezy

## Architectural Patterns

### Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture

- **Tenant Isolation**: Database-level isolation using `tenant_id` in all tables
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Single application instance serving multiple agencies
- **Data Partitioning**: Logical separation with physical optimization opportunities
- **Resource Allocation**: Fair usage distribution across tenants

### Microservices-Ready Monolith

- **Modular Structure**: Clear domain boundaries for future service extraction
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Internal events for cross-module communication
- **API-First Design**: REST endpoints designed for both internal and external consumption
- **Service Boundaries**: Lead Management, Strategy Generation, CRM Integration, User Management

### Event Sourcing for Lead Pipeline

- **Immutable Events**: All lead interactions stored as events
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of lead progression and user actions
- **Replay Capability**: Ability to reconstruct lead state at any point
- **Analytics Foundation**: Rich data for business intelligence and ML training

## Domain Patterns

### Conversation State Management

- **Finite State Machine**: Lead qualification follows defined conversation flow
- **Context Persistence**: Conversation state survives user sessions
- **Branching Logic**: Dynamic question routing based on previous answers
- **Rollback Capability**: Users can modify previous answers

### Strategy Generation Pipeline

- **Template System**: Base strategy templates for different industry sectors
- **Parameter Injection**: Dynamic content based on lead qualification data
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated checks for strategy completeness and coherence
- **Version Control**: Track strategy template evolution and performance

### CRM Integration Pattern

- **Idempotent Operations**: Safe retry mechanisms for external API calls
- **Data Mapping**: Flexible field mapping between Markezy and external systems
- **Sync Status Tracking**: Clear visibility into integration health
- **Failure Handling**: Graceful degradation when external systems unavailable

## Security Patterns

### Zero-Trust Authentication

- **JWT Token Management**: Stateless authentication with refresh token rotation
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions per user role and tenant
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and resource exhaustion
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeouts

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted in database
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **PII Handling**: Special treatment for personally identifiable information
- **RGPD Compliance**: Built-in consent management and data retention policies

### Tenant Security

- **Data Isolation**: Guaranteed separation between tenant data
- **Access Controls**: Users can only access their tenant's data
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of data access and modifications
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security validation of tenant boundaries

## Integration Patterns

### External API Management

- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures from external service issues
- **Retry with Backoff**: Intelligent retry strategies for transient failures
- **API Versioning**: Handle multiple versions of external APIs gracefully
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance monitoring for integrations

### Webhook Management

- **Event Delivery**: Reliable delivery of events to external systems
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed webhook deliveries
- **Signature Verification**: Cryptographic verification of webhook authenticity
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Handle permanently failed webhook deliveries

## Performance Patterns

### Caching Strategy

- **Redis Caching**: Hot data caching for frequently accessed information
- **CDN Integration**: Static asset delivery through content delivery network
- **Database Query Optimization**: Indexed queries and connection pooling
- **Application-Level Caching**: In-memory caching for computation-heavy operations

### Asynchronous Processing

- **Celery Task Queue**: Background processing for time-intensive operations
- **Strategy Generation**: AI strategy creation as background tasks
- **PDF Generation**: Document creation without blocking user interface
- **Email Processing**: Asynchronous email delivery and tracking

### Auto-Scaling Preparation

- **Stateless Services**: Design for horizontal scaling capability
- **Load Balancer Ready**: Application designed for load distribution
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker-based deployment for elastic scaling

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring

- **Health Checks**: Endpoint monitoring for service availability
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, and error rates
- **Business Metrics**: Lead conversion rates, user engagement, revenue impact
- **Alert System**: Proactive notification of system issues

### Logging Strategy

- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for machine processing
- **Correlation IDs**: Track requests across service boundaries
- **Security Logs**: Comprehensive audit trail for security events
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error collection and analysis

### User Analytics

- **Usage Patterns**: Track feature adoption and user behavior
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor user experience metrics
- **A/B Testing**: Framework for feature experimentation
- **Conversion Funnel**: Track lead progression through qualification process
