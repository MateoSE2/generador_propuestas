## Key Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- **Technology Stack**: Fixed stack (Python 3.12, Django, React, MySQL, Redis, Docker)
- **Infrastructure**: Single IONOS VPS for both staging and production
- **Integration Requirements**: Mandatory Clientify CRM integration

- **Budget**: Resource-constrained development with single VPS deployment

### Scope Constraints

- **Core Features Only**: Focus on Lead Magnet module for MVP
- **No Premium Features**: Payment processing and advanced analytics post-MVP
- **No Mobile Apps**: Web-responsive design only for initial release
- **Limited Integrations**: Clientify only for MVP, additional integrations in future phases

## Success Criteria

### MVP Success Metrics

### Technical Success Metrics

- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime during business hours
- **Lead Processing**: Complete lead qualification process in <15 minutes
- **Integration Reliability**: 99.9% successful Clientify synchronization rate
- **Security**: Zero security incidents or data breaches

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks

- **Single Point of Failure**: VPS-based deployment creates availability risk
- **Integration Dependency**: Clientify API availability critical for lead management
