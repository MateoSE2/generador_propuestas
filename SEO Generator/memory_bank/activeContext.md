## Key Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack Updates

1. **Backend**: Django 4.2+ (instead of FastAPI)
2. **Database**: MySQL 8.0+ (instead of PostgreSQL)
3. **Integration**: Microservices with existing AI assistants platform
4. **WordPress**: Plugin enhancement for bidirectional sync

### Microservices Integration

1. **User Management**: Sync with existing tenant/user system
2. **Authentication**: Shared JWT tokens across services
3. **Data Sync**: Real-time synchronization of user/tenant data
4. **Service Communication**: REST APIs with circuit breakers

### WordPress Integration Strategy

1. **Existing Asset**: WordPress plugin already developed (unidirectional)
2. **Enhancement Needed**: Add bidirectional sync capabilities
3. **Communication**: REST API between WordPress and Django backend
4. **Complexity Advantage**: Foundation already exists (+20% progress)

## Cost Estimation Summary

### Total Project Cost: $23,000 - $34,000

- **Foundation Features**: $4,000 - $6,000 (Critical path)
- **Core Features**: $7,500 - $11,000 (Parallel development possible)
- **Advanced Features**: $9,500 - $14,000 (Enhancement phase)
- **Infrastructure**: $2,000 - $3,000 (Supporting all development)

### Feature Dependencies & Critical Path

1. **User/Tenant Management** ‚Üí **Simple Dashboard** ‚Üí **Simple Parametrization**
2. **Simple Parametrization** ‚Üí **WordPress Integration** + **Excel Integration** (parallel)
3. **All Core Features** ‚Üí **Advanced Features** (parallel development)

## Immediate Next Steps

### Development Environment Setup

1. Django project initialization with MySQL
2. React TypeScript frontend setup
3. Docker containerization for all services
4. Microservices authentication integration
5. Database schema with existing UUID sync

### WordPress Plugin Enhancement

1. Review existing plugin architecture
2. Plan bidirectional sync enhancement
3. Define API endpoints for generated content
4. Design WordPress admin interface updates

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

- **Microservices Integration**: +10% complexity buffer allocated
- **WordPress Plugin Modifications**: +15% buffer for unknown complexities
- **Django/MySQL Migration**: Well-established patterns, lower risk

### Business Risks

- **Existing Plugin Dependency**: Advantage - foundation exists, reduces risk
- **AI Assistants Platform Integration**: Risk mitigated by shared team/codebase
- **Feature Cost Overruns**: Feature-based budgeting allows better control

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Development Metrics (By Feature)

- Feature completion percentage and cost tracking
- Development velocity per feature type
- Technical debt accumulation by feature
- Integration complexity actual vs. estimated

### Business Metrics (Future)

- Cost per feature for ROI calculation
- Feature adoption rates by tenant
- Feature-specific performance metrics
- User engagement by feature complexity

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team Composition

- **Backend Developer**: Django + MySQL + microservices integration
- **Frontend Developer**: React + TypeScript + modern UI frameworks
- **WordPress Developer**: Plugin enhancement and WordPress expertise
- **DevOps Engineer**: Docker + Kubernetes + microservices orchestration

### Specialized Knowledge Needed

- **Microservices Integration**: Existing AI assistants platform familiarity
- **WordPress Development**: Plugin architecture and WooCommerce integration
- **Multi-tenant SaaS**: Database design and tenant isolation
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration and subscription management

## Quality Assurance Strategy
