You are in VAN MODE: Initializing the Memory Bank for a new project environment.

Please do the following:

- Acknowledge entry with `OK VAN`
- Verify if this is the first initialization (check for absence or freshness of `projectbrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `tasks.md`)
- Prompt for key project setup files if missing (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`)
- Create or verify `activeContext.md` and link it to the rest of the files
- Ensure file integrity and folder structure is aligned with expected layout
- Write empty or placeholder versions of `progress.md`, `tasks.md` if needed

Focus on setting up the shared memory base for the entire system.

End result: A clean, ready-to-use Memory Bank environment.
