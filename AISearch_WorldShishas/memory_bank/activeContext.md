# Active Context - AISearch_WorldShishas

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-30  
**Status**: Memory Bank Initialized  
**Phase**: VAN Mode Complete

## Project Overview

This Memory Bank contains the foundational knowledge for developing an intelligent search system for World Shishas, leveraging AI-powered hybrid search to improve product discovery and user experience.

## Memory Bank Structure

### Core Foundation Files

- **[projectbrief.md](./projectbrief.md)** - Problem-solution pitch and business value proposition
- **[productContext.md](./productContext.md)** - Target audience, pain points, and business goals
- **[systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md)** - Architectural patterns and design approaches
- **[techContext.md](./techContext.md)** - Technology stack, deployment, and technical requirements

### Functional Specifications

- **[functionalities.md](./functionalities.md)** - Detailed functionality catalog and requirements
- **[tasks.md](./tasks.md)** - Task tracking and implementation roadmap
- **[progress.md](./progress.md)** - Implementation progress and milestones

## Current Project Focus

### Primary Objective

Develop a **hybrid search system** that combines exact keyword matching with AI-powered semantic search to improve product discovery on World Shishas WordPress site.

### MVP Scope

- **Backend**: New `/api/v1/hybrid-search/` endpoint in existing byNeural Django infrastructure
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript WordPress plugin with modal search interface
- **Integration**: Seamless connection between WordPress frontend and byNeural API
- **Performance**: Sub-2-second response times with 99% availability

### Key Success Criteria

- Functional hybrid search combining exact + semantic results
- User-friendly WordPress plugin with modern interface
- Minimal disruption to existing infrastructure
- Foundation for future enhancements (analytics, personalization)

## Technology Integration Points

### Existing Infrastructure (byNeural)

- Django 3.2 backend with established patterns
- MySQL database with product catalog
- Celery + Redis for async processing
- Docker containerization setup

### New Components

- Qdrant vector database for semantic search
- OpenAI API integration for embeddings
- React/TypeScript WordPress plugin
- Hybrid search orchestration layer

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- Memory Bank initialization ✅
- Requirements gathering and documentation ✅
- Technical architecture planning

### Phase 2: Backend Development (Next)

- Hybrid search endpoint implementation
- Vector database setup and indexing
- API testing and optimization

### Phase 3: Frontend Development

- WordPress plugin development
- React/TypeScript interface implementation
- Integration testing with backend

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing

- End-to-end functionality testing
- Performance optimization
- User acceptance testing

## Dependencies and Constraints

### External Dependencies

- byNeural infrastructure availability
- OpenAI API access and quotas
- Qdrant vector database deployment
- WordPress hosting environment compatibility

### Project Constraints

- No modifications to existing byNeural core functionality
- WordPress plugin must be self-contained and distributable
- Spanish language only for MVP
- Performance requirements: <2s response time, 99% uptime

## Quality Assurance Focus

### Technical Quality

- API response time monitoring
- Search result relevance testing
- Cross-browser compatibility verification
- Mobile responsiveness validation

### User Experience Quality

- Intuitive search interface design
- Clear loading states and error handling
- Accessibility considerations (future enhancement)
- Consistent visual design with existing site

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

- Vector database performance under load
- API integration complexity
- WordPress plugin compatibility issues
- Search result quality tuning

### Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive testing environment setup
- Fallback to basic search if hybrid fails
- Extensive browser and WordPress version testing
- Iterative search quality improvement process
